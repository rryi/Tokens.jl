Hi,

I am working on package [(https://github.com/rryi/Tokens.jl)], it is in an early state (not registered, surely with lots of bugs), but now it compiles without error messages.

After `using Tokens`, I get the following "internal error" in the julia workspace viewer:
![2021-02-25 14_18_27-? flytoken jl - Tokens - Visual Studio Code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26365322/109164050-43138400-777a-11eb-9b50-48ba65a73797.png)

I tried to reinstall VSCode plus julia plugin - error remains. I got the same error on another machine. 

### Environment:

- PC Ryzen 1700 with 16 GB RAM
- Windows 10 Pro 20H1
- VSCode 1.5.3, portable installation
- julialang.language-julia 1.1.29

### Steps to reproduce:

 - install VSCode and julia plugin
 - get Tokens package, commit 606345c82baf64df9fa76fd99b547d73eaa7b9ce
 - open Tokens folder in VSCode
 - switch julia environment to Tokens folder in VSCode (VSCode should ask for that)
 - open julia workspace in VSCode
 - enter REPL
 - enter Pkg, instantiate, exit to julia REPL
 - enter `using Tokens` in REPL


I am quite new to julia-vscode, but very pleased with it and like its tools for code analysis and debugging. I have no idea about the error and
